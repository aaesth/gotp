this uses the legacy api key shown in the image<br><img src="https://github.com/aaesth/gotp/blob/main/2024-02-17_00-54.png?raw=true"><br>
you will also need to make an application for the api key
<br>
DO NOT SHARE THIS KEY WITH ANYONE<br>
add this key to the fields that need it in code and then run it
